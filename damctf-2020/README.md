These are my writeups for the damctf competition from Oct 9, 2020 to Oct 11, 2020.
This was my first ever ctf competition and I had a blast trying out all the
different challenges out. I learned many things from this ctf as well, such as
HTTP requests and parsing with finger_warmup. Thanks for stopping by to read
these!
